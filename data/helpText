Argument examples:
java Main all --runs the simulation with approach 100K samples for each division estimated and naive
java Main [div] --runs the simulation with approach 100K samples for [div] using estimated technique
java Main [div] naive --runs the simulation with approach 100K samples for [div] using naive technique
java Main [div] [n] --runs the simulation with approach [n] samples for one [div] estimated technique
java Main [div] [n] naive --runs the simulation with approach [n] samples for [div] using naive technique
java Main [div] [n] [file] --runs the simulation with approach [n] samples for [div] using naive technique
                             using [file] as the teamfile.
                             
[div] - Any division, "H", "A", "BE", "BW", "CE", "CW", "DW", "DE"
[n] - Any positive number (the number of trials you want. Larger is more precise, but takes longer.
[file] - The name of a correctly formatted teams file in the /data subfolder.
all - Literally the string all
naive - Literally the string naive
